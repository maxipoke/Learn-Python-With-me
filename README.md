# Python Mastery: Depth-First Search Learning Path

> *Master every nuance before moving forward. No topic left behind.*

## 🎯 Philosophy

This repository follows a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** learning methodology. Unlike traditional breadth-first approaches that skim the surface of many topics, we dive deep into each concept, mastering it from basic syntax to advanced internals and real-world problem-solving before moving to the next topic.

### Why DFS?

- **Deep Understanding**: Master fundamentals before building complexity
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Focus on one topic at a time
- **Professional Readiness**: Understand CPython internals, memory management, and optimization
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Apply concepts through curated LeetCode-style problems

## 📚 Target Audience

- **College Beginners**: Building a solid foundation from scratch
- **Career Switchers**: Transitioning to Python from other languages
- **Working Professionals**: Refreshing and deepening Python knowledge
- **Interview Candidates**: Preparing with structured problem-solving practice

## 📖 Curriculum Structure

### The 3-Notebook Rule

Every major topic follows a consistent three-notebook structure:

1. **`_Basic.ipynb`**: Syntax, standard methods, and "getting it working"
   - Target: Beginners
   - Focus: How to use it correctly

2. **`_Advanced.ipynb`**: CPython internals, memory management, optimization, and "gotchas"
   - Target: Professionals
   - Focus: Why it works this way

3. **`_Problems.ipynb`**: Application through curated problems
   - Target: All learners
   - Structure: Intuition → Brute Force → Optimized Solution
   - Difficulty: Easy → Medium → Hard/Pattern-based

## 🗂️ Learning Path

### 01_Core_Python
Master the fundamental data types and control structures.

- **01_Numbers**: Integers, floats, complex numbers, and numeric operations
- **02_Strings**: String manipulation, formatting, and encoding
- **03_Lists_and_Tuples**: Sequences, mutability, and immutability
- **04_Dictionaries_and_Sets**: Hash maps, hashability, and set operations
- **05_Control_Flow**: Conditionals, loops, and comprehensions

### 02_Functions_and_OOP
Build reusable code and understand Python's object model.

- **01_Functions**: Function definition, scoping, decorators, and closures
- **02_Object_Oriented_Programming**: Classes, inheritance, magic methods, and MRO
- **03_Modules_and_Packages**: Import system, namespace packages, and distribution

### 03_System_Integration
Interact with the system and handle errors gracefully.

- **01_File_Handling**: Reading, writing, and context managers
- **02_Exception_Handling**: Try-except, custom exceptions, and error handling patterns

### 04_Standard_Library_DeepDive
Leverage Python's powerful standard library.

- **01_DateTime**: Time zones, formatting, and arithmetic
- **02_Collections**: NamedTuple, deque, Counter, and specialized containers
- **03_itertools_and_functools**: Functional programming tools and generators

### 05_External_Libraries
Extend Python's capabilities with essential third-party libraries.

- **01_Data_Analysis_Stack**: NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames
- **02_Visualization**: Matplotlib plotting and customization
- **03_Web_Interactions**: HTTP requests and API consumption

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-mastery-dfs
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   jupyter lab
   ```

### Learning Workflow

1. **Start with Basic**: Read and execute all cells in `_Basic.ipynb`
2. **Deepen with Advanced**: Understand internals in `_Advanced.ipynb`
3. **Apply with Problems**: Solve problems in `_Problems.ipynb`
4. **Move Forward**: Only proceed to the next topic after completing all three notebooks

## 📝 Notebook Format

Each notebook follows this structure:

- **Header**: Title, Goal, and Key Takeaways
- **Theory**: Markdown explanations with tables and visualizations
- **Code**: Executable examples with outputs
- **Exercises**: Hands-on practice problems
- **Summary**: Key concepts recap
